Think of UI as the tools a user needs for their journey—elegant, precise, and pleasing. UX is the path itself—the ease of navigation, the anticipation of their needs, and the satisfaction of reaching their destination effortlessly. Together, they create a harmonious digital environment that not only looks exceptional but also feels right.</p>
